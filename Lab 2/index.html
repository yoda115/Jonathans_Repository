                    <p>There is no specific message or reasoning to this site, I just wanted - as a apprentice barista - to share my love for coffee. Please enjoy my stock photo of coffee. I am drinking coffee at 7PM while typing this code and I will be drinking coffee at 7AM at work tomorrow</p>

                    <p>Here, I will be posting a stock image of coffee, as well as linking the coffee shop I currently work at (tell your friends).</p>
