                <p>Bonnie "Prince" Billy (real name Joseph Will Oldham) is an American singer-songwriter, known for his "do-it-yourself punk aesthetic and blunt honesty".</p><br>
                <p>His music has been likened to Americana, country, indie rock, punk, and folk.</p><br>
                <p>Oldham adopted the 'Bonnie "Prince" Billy' moniker in 1998, drawing inspiration from many different sources:</p>
                <p>"The name has so many different references that it could almost have a life of its own. Bonnie Prince Charlie has such a beautiful ring to it, and I was very conscious of appropriating that mellifluous sound.</p> 
                <p>And I was also thinking about the name Nat King Cole. But it wasn't until later, and this may have been subconscious, that I remembered that Billy the Kid was William Bonney or Billy Bonney".</p>
